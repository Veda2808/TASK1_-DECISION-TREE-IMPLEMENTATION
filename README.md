**This project focuses on building and visualizing a Decision Tree Classification model using the Scikit-learn library in Python. The well-known Iris dataset is used for classification of flower species based on input features such as petal and sepal measurements.

The model is trained, tested, evaluated, and visualized within the Jupyter Notebook environment, providing an interactive and comprehensive interface for development and analysis.

The model uses the entropy criterion to split nodes, helping to create a tree that can easily be interpreted and visualized. Confusion matrices and accuracy scores are used to assess the performance of the model.**
